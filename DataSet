Exercise Pose Estimation Dataset
This repository contains code to create a dataset from video files by extracting key points using MediaPipe Pose estimation. The dataset includes key points from multiple videos, labeled with the exercise type as "unknown". This dataset can be used for further processing, training, or exercise classification tasks.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of key points extracted from video frames using MediaPipe Pose estimation. The key points include coordinates of various body parts such as wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles. Each frame's key points are labeled with the exercise type "unknown".

Key Points
The extracted key points for each frame include:

wrist_left_x, wrist_left_y: Coordinates of the left wrist
wrist_right_x, wrist_right_y: Coordinates of the right wrist
elbow_left_x, elbow_left_y: Coordinates of the left elbow
elbow_right_x, elbow_right_y: Coordinates of the right elbow
shoulder_left_x, shoulder_left_y: Coordinates of the left shoulder
shoulder_right_x, shoulder_right_y: Coordinates of the right shoulder
hip_left_x, hip_left_y: Coordinates of the left hip
hip_right_x, hip_right_y: Coordinates of the right hip
knee_left_x, knee_left_y: Coordinates of the left knee
knee_right_x, knee_right_y: Coordinates of the right knee
ankle_left_x, ankle_left_y: Coordinates of the left ankle
ankle_right_x, ankle_right_y: Coordinates of the right ankle
Each entry also contains a label Exercise which is set to "unknown".

Usage
Data Extraction: The provided code processes multiple videos, extracts pose estimation key points, and saves them into a CSV file.
Dataset Creation: Run the script to generate a combined dataset from the specified videos.
Further Processing: Use the dataset for training machine learning models or other analyses.
Example
The dataset CSV file will have the following structure:
